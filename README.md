# Cloud cover detection
This repo (working version) contains just one jupyter notebook *analyze_data* and some other files for running DrivenData competition - [On Cloud N: Cloud Cover Detection Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/83/cloud-cover/page/396/). First code was partialy (at this time almost all code) overtaken from this [notebook](https://www.drivendata.co/blog/cloud-cover-benchmark/).

For run this notebook properly you will need:

1) download data. For this follow instructions in data_download_instructions.txt
2) update file paths if needed
